# Deployment-of-3-Tier-Applications-Using-AWS-Services
This project demonstrates a manually deployed 3-tier architecture on AWS for a web application where users can submit data, which is then stored in a backend database. The setup does not use DevOps tools (like Jenkins, Docker, or Kubernetes) and relies on AWS native services for hosting, networking, and storage
